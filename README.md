This project is a **car price prediction** tool built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. The model leverages **machine learning** techniques to predict the price of a car based on various input features like model year, mileage, engine type, and more. 


## Features
- Predicts car prices based on user-provided details
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit for easy usability
- Data preprocessing, transformation, and model loading handled in the backend

## Project Structure
```

   │
   ├── main.py                  # Main Streamlit application
   ├── car_price_model.joblib   # Trained machine learning model

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser by going to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

- Enter details like car model, year, mileage, transmission type, and other relevant information.
- Click the "Predict Price" button to get an estimated price.

## Model Training
The model was trained using various features, including:
- **Model year**
- **Mileage**
- **Transmission type**
- **Fuel type**
- **Engine capacity** and more...

The model was saved using **joblib** and can be reloaded for predictions.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:
- **Streamlit** - For building the interactive web application
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning model training and pipeline management
- **XGBoost** - For the prediction model
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and preprocessing
